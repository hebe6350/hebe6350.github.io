							The Fuel Your Future Networking Gala was a project for a client at Laurier. The client had a vision for their event to feature their brand colours - red and navy, and capture the sports theme without being too pushy. The execution of the designs for Fuel Your Future ended up with a very geometric futuristic look, playing on the popular themes in the sporting industry. This project also featured a facebook banner, an instagram sized graphic, and a large 1980x1080 graphic to be featured on the brands instagram story - a growing platform for the client.

							The Sidelines project was a logo created for the same client at Laurier - SML. This graphic also played up the brands current colours while creating a fully new brand image that would be used as a second tier program for their organization. They were inspired by the graphics created for large organizations such as the CFL and MLB for specialty games - from the Grey Cup to the MLB All-Star game. This graphic was tailored to have a very similar feel.

								The General Meeting campaign was created for Sports Management Laurier’s introduction meeting for general members. They wanted a design that tailored to the sports theme of their organization that as modern and eye-catching. The smoke effect of the background on the hockey arena tied together the sports theme and gave enough drama to be impactful.
